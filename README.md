An example of what this profile should look like

![Example](/example.jpg)

The profile uses 3 powershell scripts to help you learn powershell as you use it, that couple with PSReadLine's intellisense type functionality have really helped me learn quicker ways to write my powershell scripts and oneliners. 

Most of what I've learned I owe to Lee Holmes who's the author of the three scripts I use to enable the alias suggestions.
